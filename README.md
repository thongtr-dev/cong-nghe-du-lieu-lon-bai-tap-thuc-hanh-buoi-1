# Big Data Python Exercises 1

This repository contains Python exercises and assignments for the Big Data course at UIT.

## Project Structure

- `main.py` — Main entry point for running exercises. (placeholder file, currently not used)
- `baitap01.py`, `baitap02.py`, `baitap03.py` — Individual exercise scripts.
- `data_phanso.txt` — Text file containing data for fraction (phân số) exercise.
- `artifacts/` — Output or generated files (if any).
- `pyproject.toml`, `uv.lock` — Project dependencies and environment management files.

## Getting Started

1. **Install Python 3.8+**
2. **Sync dependencies with uv:**
   ```zsh
   uv sync
   ```
3. **Execute exercise scripts:**
   Run any of the following commands to execute the corresponding exercise:

   ```zsh
   uv run baitap01.py   # Run Exercise 1
   uv run baitap02.py   # Run Exercise 2
   uv run baitap03.py   # Run Exercise 3
   ```

## Notes

- Each exercise script can be run independently.
- You can update or add data in `data_phanso.txt` as needed for fraction-related exercise.
